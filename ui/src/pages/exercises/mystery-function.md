Write a function `String mystery(int number)` that returns a string based on the number. If the number is divisible by 5, the function should return the string "mys". If the number is divisible by 7, the function should return the string "tery". If the number is divisible by both 5 and 7, the function should return the string "mystery". Otherwise, the function should return a string representation of the given number, e.g. if the number is 1, the function should return "1".
