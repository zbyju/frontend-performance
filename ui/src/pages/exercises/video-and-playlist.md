Implement the classes `Video` and `Playlist` as follows. The class Video should have a name (`String`), a duration in seconds (`int`), a constructor with named arguments, and a `toString` method. The default name should be "Unknown" and the default length should be 0. The class should work as follows.

```java
print(Video(name: "One second clip", duration: 1));
print(Video(name: "Hello again!", duration: 84));
```

With the code above, the output should be as follows.

One second clip (1 second)
Hello again! (84 seconds)

The class `Playlist` should contain a list of videos, provide a default (no argument) constructor, and offer the following methods: (1) `void add(Video video)` that adds a video to the playlist, (2) bool has(`String name`) that returns true if the list of videos contains a video with the given name, and (3) `int duration()` that returns the sum of durations of the videos in the playlist. The class should work as follows.

```java
final playlist = Playlist();
print(playlist.has("One second clip"));
print(playlist.duration());
playlist.add(Video(name: "One second clip", duration: 1));
playlist.add(Video(name: "Hello again!", duration: 84));
print(playlist.has("One second clip"));
print(playlist.duration());
```

With the code above, the output should be as follows.

```java
false
0
true
85
```
