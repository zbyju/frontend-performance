Write a function `String sumWithFormula(int first, int second)` that returns the written out sum of the given integers and the sum. As an example, the function call `sumWithFormula(1, 2)` should return the string 1+2=3 and the function call `sumWithFormula(1, 1)` should return the string 1+1=2. Note! Do not add spaces to the returned string.
